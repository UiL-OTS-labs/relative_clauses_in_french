Experiment:
        Self-Paced Reading with Stationary Window

Description:
        Purpose of this experiment is to measure word or segment reading times
        in sentences, using a self-paced word/segment revealing mechanism. 
        Participant's task is to read sentences which are presented in a 
        segment-by-segment fashion. Participant reveals next segment by hitting
        a button. RT is measured from the presentation of a segment to button-
        press. For each sentence there is a 50% chance of a comprehension 
        question to be asked. Self-paced. Output: RT per segment.

        This particular SPR implementation uses a stationary window: For each
        segment the text in the segment is displayed at a fixed position on the
        screen. So basically the segment window is stationary and the sentence
        moves underneath it segment by segment.
